# Curating models from Biomodels: Developing a workflow for creating OMEX files

## Introduction

Some widely adopted standards and public repositories can facilitate the reproducibility of computational biology models that go beyond the specific software. As a test of curation, we examined a selection of models in the BioModels Database. For each model, we reproduced some published results using Tellurium. Once reproduced we manually created a standard Open Modeling EXchange (OMEX) file using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and the Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML). These exercises allowed us to develop a workflow that we would use to develop an online platform to help users more easily and automatically curate models for https://biosimulations.org and www.reproducibilityportal.org.
